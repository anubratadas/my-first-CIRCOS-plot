# my-first-CIRCOS-plot
CIRCOS plot of bacterial genome
I tried to plot the genome in R using circlize and RCircos. I found these were optimized for human genomes and finally fell back to the original CIRCOS. 
I first had to install additional perl modules in my fedora 31 using cpanm as given in the CIRCOS guide("http://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/configuration/perl_and_modules/") 
next created the karyotype file from the genome size given at ncbi genome
rest was easy using the tutorials at circos.ca
